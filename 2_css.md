# CSS

Why CSS?
- Using only tables in HTML requires too much code
- It is easy to make syntax errors - too many ```<td>``` tags - just one error will throw off entire document

## Inline CSS

```<body style="">```
- Inline: using style directly with an HTML element
- The style attribute takes in CSS code

## Colors

- use: https://colorhunt.co
- database with color palletts and their HEX values for easy CSS integration

## Internal CSS

- Editing CSS inside the ```<head>``` tag of our HTML document:
```HTML
  <style>
      body {
        background-color: blue;
      }
  </style>
```

## Default CSS

- All elements have default CSS
- Use: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_default_values.asp and control + F search the element to find it's default CSS values

## "A whole bunch of boxes"

- Everything on your webpage is just a whole bunch of boxes

## Syntax for a CSS element

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-style
- The border-style property may be specified using one, two, three, or four values.
- When one value is specified, it applies the same style to all four sides.
- When two values are specified, the first style applies to the top and bottom, the second to the left and right.
- When three values are specified, the first style applies to the top, the second to the left and right, the third to the bottom.
- When four values are specified, the styles apply to the top, right, bottom, and left in that order (clockwise).
